We're excited to announce that our lab has been awarded a major research grant from the National Science Foundation to support our work on computer vision algorithms for autonomous systems.

## Project Overview

The $500,000 grant will fund our research on developing more efficient and accurate computer vision algorithms for real-time object detection and tracking in autonomous vehicles.

## Research Impact

This funding will support:

- Two PhD students for the next three years
- New GPU computing infrastructure
- Collaboration with industry partners

## Next Steps

We're currently recruiting talented graduate students interested in computer vision and deep learning to join this project. [Learn more about opportunities here](/join/).

## About the Funding

This research is supported by NSF Grant No. 2025-12345. Any opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.
