This week, three members of our lab presented their cutting-edge research at the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2025 in Stockholm, Sweden.

## Research Presentations

Our team showcased two papers that highlight our recent advances in robotic perception:

### 1. "Real-time 6D Object Pose Estimation for Robotic Manipulation"

This paper introduces a novel deep learning architecture that can accurately estimate the 6D pose of objects in cluttered environments with previously unseen objects. The system achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining real-time processing speeds suitable for dynamic robotic manipulation tasks.

**Presenters:** [PhD Student 1] and [PhD Student 2]

### 2. "Self-Supervised Visual-Tactile Learning for Robotic Grasping"

This work demonstrates a multimodal approach that combines visual and tactile information to improve grasping success rates for objects with complex geometries or deformable properties. The self-supervised learning framework allows robots to improve their grasping capabilities through interaction, without requiring extensive manual labeling.

**Presenter:** [PhD Student 3]

## Collaboration Opportunities

The conference provided valuable opportunities to connect with researchers from leading robotics labs and companies worldwide. Several potential collaborations were discussed with teams from:

- [University 1] on combining our visual perception models with their motion planning algorithms
- [Company 1] on potential industrial applications of our grasping technology
- [Research Institute] on extending our work to mobile manipulation scenarios

## Demo Highlights

Our researchers also participated in the demonstration session, where they showcased a live demo of our robotic system performing grasp detection and execution on challenging everyday objects with varying shapes, sizes, and material properties.

The demo received significant attention from both academic researchers and industry representatives, highlighting the practical applicability of our research.

## Looking Forward

The feedback received during the conference has provided valuable insights for refining our approaches and identifying new research directions. Our team is now working on incorporating these insights into our ongoing projects.

We look forward to expanding on this research and presenting new advances at upcoming robotics conferences.
