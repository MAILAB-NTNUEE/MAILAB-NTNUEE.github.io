We're proud to announce that our lab's paper "Self-supervised Learning for Resource-Constrained Visual Recognition" has received the Best Paper Award at the 2025 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).

The paper, authored by Dr. Sarah Kim, Robert Zhang, and Professor Jane Chen, presents a novel approach to training deep learning models with limited labeled data, achieving state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.

CVPR is one of the most prestigious conferences in the field of computer vision, and this recognition highlights our lab's commitment to pushing the boundaries of what's possible in visual recognition systems.

The award committee praised the work for its innovative methodology and potential impact on making advanced computer vision accessible in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and IoT applications.
