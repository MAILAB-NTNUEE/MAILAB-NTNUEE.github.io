Our lab has launched a new research project exploring advanced visual recognition models for medical imaging. This project aims to develop deep learning algorithms that can assist radiologists in diagnosing various conditions from X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.

The team will be focusing on creating models that can not only detect abnormalities but also provide explanations for their predictions, making them more trustworthy for clinical use. This research is funded by a new grant from the National Science Foundation.

The project will combine computer vision techniques with natural language processing to generate comprehensive reports from medical images, similar to those written by radiologists. We believe this approach will significantly reduce the time needed for diagnosis while maintaining high accuracy.

Graduate students interested in working on this project should contact Professor Chen for potential opportunities.
