        "excerpt":"Our lab has launched a new research project exploring advanced visual recognition models for medical imaging. This project aims to develop deep learning algorithms that can assist radiologists in diagnosing various conditions from X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs.   The team will be focusing on creating models that can not only detect abnormalities but also provide explanations for their predictions, making them more trustworthy for clinical use. This research is funded by a new grant from the National Science Foundation.   The project will combine computer vision techniques with natural language processing to generate comprehensive reports from medical images, similar to those written by radiologists. We believe this approach will significantly reduce the time needed for diagnosis while maintaining high accuracy.   Graduate students interested in working on this project should contact Professor Chen for potential opportunities.  ","categories": ["Research"],

        "title": "MAILAB Team Wins Best Paper Award at CVPR 2025",
        "excerpt":"We’re proud to announce that our lab’s paper “Self-supervised Learning for Resource-Constrained Visual Recognition” has received the Best Paper Award at the 2025 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR).   The paper, authored by Dr. Sarah Kim, Robert Zhang, and Professor Jane Chen, presents a novel approach to training deep learning models with limited labeled data, achieving state-of-the-art performance while requiring significantly fewer computational resources.   CVPR is one of the most prestigious conferences in the field of computer vision, and this recognition highlights our lab’s commitment to pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in visual recognition systems.   The award committee praised the work for its innovative methodology and potential impact on making advanced computer vision accessible in resource-constrained environments like mobile devices and IoT applications.
