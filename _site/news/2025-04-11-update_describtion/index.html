<p>Let me summarize what’s now in place in your website:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Complete News Collection Framework</strong>: You now have a fully functioning news system based on Jekyll collections with:
    <ul>
      <li>A dedicated _news directory with sample content</li>
      <li>A template file that team members can copy to create new entries</li>
      <li>Custom layouts and styling for beautiful presentation</li>
      <li>Filtering capabilities by tags and categories</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Recent Sample News Items</strong>: I’ve created several example news items based on your existing posts and added a new one (the ICRA conference presentation) to show how recent updates would be added.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Responsive Design</strong>: The news layout works well on all devices and includes visual elements like card layouts, date badges, category tags, and featured images.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="how-to-use-the-system-going-forward">How to Use the System Going Forward</h2>

<p>For your team to add news, they should:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Copy the Template</strong>: Duplicate <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template-news-item.md</code> or any existing news item</li>
  <li><strong>Rename the File</strong>: Follow the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-title-with-hyphens.md</code> format</li>
  <li><strong>Edit the Front Matter</strong>: Change title, date, categories, tags, and excerpt</li>
  <li><strong>Write Content</strong>: Add markdown content for the news item</li>
  <li><strong>Add Images</strong>: Place images in news and reference them</li>
</ol>

<p>The beauty of this system is that anyone on your team, regardless of web design experience, can add news items by simply creating markdown files. Jekyll automatically handles all the display formatting based on the templates and styles we’ve set up.</p>

<h2 id="images-for-news-items">Images for News Items</h2>

<p>For a fully polished look, you’ll want to add images for your news items. I’ve set up the directory structure for these with news. For each news item, consider adding:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A featured image (larger, used at the top of the article page)</li>
  <li>A teaser image (smaller, used for card displays on the main news page)</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="next-steps-for-you">Next Steps for You</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Share the Guide</strong>: Make sure your team knows about the ADDING_NEWS_GUIDE.md file</li>
  <li><strong>Add Real Images</strong>: Replace the placeholder image references with actual images for your news items</li>
  <li><strong>Customize Tags &amp; Categories</strong>: Adjust the suggested categories and tags in the guide to match your lab’s focus areas</li>
</ol>

<p>Would you like me to explain any other aspect of the news system? Or would you like me to make any adjustments to the implementation?</p>
